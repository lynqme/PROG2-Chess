In the Game class a promotion class was implemented in which a pawn can be promoted. This functions with an if else statement that determines if it is white or black and in which extreme of the board the piece is in.
In the move method the isLegalMove() method is called which could possibly throw an IllegalChessMove Exception. Also, the piece is moved if the isLegalMove() is true. Then there is a conditional statement to test if the move qualifies a promotion and then it switches to the next turn.
Capture is used to capture a piece and it starts by using the isLegalCapture() method. If it is true it proceeds with capturing the piece.
isLegalMove() states the rules for each piece an determines if that piece can move the way the user is asking to move. 
isLegalCapture states the rules for each piece to capture another piece and tests the legality of the player's move.
